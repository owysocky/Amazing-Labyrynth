                  <p>
                    Here are some rules for you!
                    Shuffle the cards and place them face up on the board at random, thereby creating a chance patterning of
                    maze corridors. One maze card will be left over. Shuffle the 24 treasure cards and deal them out equally
                    among the players face down. Choose a playing piece and place it on the board on the corner position of the
                    same color.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Turns are taken in clockwise direction. The players decide who will begin.
                    If you are the first player, look at your first treasure card and return it, face down, to your pile of cards. This
                    is your first GOAL in the labyrinth. You may not look at your other cards until you have reached this first
                    GOAL.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To reach your goal you must shift the walls of the maze. This is done by pushing the extra maze card into
                    the labyrinth at some point so that you can move as far as you wish along its open passageways.
                    From the edge of the board push the extra maze card into the labyrinth. The places where the maze card can
                    be added are indicated on the edge of the board by an arrow. The maze card that is pushed out will become
                    the next player's means of shifthing the maze. Until the next player's turn, the new extra maze card is left
                    where it is so that all players will know how the maze has been shifted on this turn.
                    You must move the maze before each turn, even if you don't need to in order to reach your goal. This way
                    you can wall in another player!
                    You may not immediately reverse the last player's move by returning the extra card to the position it was
                    just pushed out of.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the shifting maze pushes out a player's piece, the piece is transferred to the newly inserted maze card at
                    the other side. This applies whether the piece belongs to the person making the move or to another player.
                    Transferring this piece does not count as a move.
                    After shifting the maze, move your playing piece as far as you choose along the open corridor. You can also
                    choose not to move at all. Often you will be able to reach your goal in one move. If not, try to get in the best
                    possible position for your next turn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More than one playing piece can occupy a single square. Once you reach your first goal, turn over the top
                    treasure card and leave it face up beside your pile of cards. The next card in the pile will be your next goal.
                    The turn then passes to the next player.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    END OF GAME: Once you have reached all your goals you must return to the corner position from which
                    you entered the labyrinth. The winner is the first player to turn up all the treasure cards and return to his or
                    her starting position.
