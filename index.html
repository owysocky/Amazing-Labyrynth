                    The board will be randomly generated based on the inputted gride size, along with one spare piece. This will
                    be the spare card that is shifted in by the first player. The players are then placed in the corners of the
                    board, with player 1 in the top left corner, player 2 in the top left, player 3 in the bottom left, and
                    player 4 in the bottom right.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Turns are taken in clockwise direction. Player 1 starts first. The order in which the treasures are to be
                    obtained are randomly generated. Look at the part of the board that says "This is the current treasure goal".
                    That is the current GOAL treasure, and that is the only treasure that can currently be obtained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To reach your goal you must shift the walls of the maze. This is done by pushing the extra maze card into
                    the labyrinth at some point so that you can move as far as you wish along its open passageways.
                    From the edge of the board push the extra maze card into the labyrinth. The places where the maze card can
                    be added are indicated on the edge of the board by a red arrow. The maze card that is pushed out will become
                    the next player's means of shifting the maze. <strong>You must move the maze before each turn</strong>,
                    even if you don't need to in order to reach your goal. This way you can wall in another player!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the shifting maze pushes out a player's piece, the piece is transferred to the newly inserted maze card at
                    the other side. This applies whether the piece belongs to the person making the move or to another player.
                    Transferring this piece does not count as a move. If a treasure if shifted out along with the piece, the
                    treasure is transferred along with the piece outside of the maze, until the next turn where it will be shifted
                    back in. After shifting the maze, move your playing piece as far as you choose along the open corridor. You can also
                    choose not to move at all. Often you will be able to reach your goal in one move. If not, try to get in the best
                    possible position for your next turn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Only one playing piece can occupy a single square. Once you reach the treasure, you will collect the treasure
                    and earn a point. The player who has the most points at the end of the game will win.
